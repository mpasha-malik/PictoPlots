# PictoPlots

Deliverables:
How I planned PictoPlots MVP?
Started from getting the icons of 10 movies from "thenounproject" api.
Got the plot data of movies from "omdbapi" after searching the id of each movie from "imdb" website.
Linked up the movie data with icons in the form of array of objects.
Rendered the Movie Icon on the page along with buttons.
Plotted the Icons and guess movie name by icons.

A short list of features:
A time limit(10 seconds) to guess each movie. 
Score for correct guessed movies out of 10.
